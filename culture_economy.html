                                                is fermentation, a metabolic process that helps food to “mature” so that

                                                ganjang (soy sauce), gochujang (chili paste), and jeotgal (fermented

                                                in Korea are doenjang and ganjang. To make them, it is necessary to soak
                                                soybeans in water and boil them until fully cooked. Then, they must be
                                                pounded
                                                and formed into brick-shaped lumps, and left to dry and ferment. Then,
                                                they are
                                                placed in salted water in a large pot along with dried red chili and
                                                heated
                                                charcoal, which help remove impurities and odors during the fermentation
                                                process. The beans thus prepared are then left for about two to three
                                                months
                                                until they become fully fermented. This product should then be divided
                                                into two,
                                                solids and liquid, of which the former needs to be brewed for over five
                                                more
                                                months and the latter for over three months to develop a full flavor and
                                                taste.
                                                Just like wine, soy sauce tends to have a richer flavor and taste when
                                                brewed
                                                for a longer period..</p>

                                            <p class="card-text">The term gugak, which literally means “national music,”
                                                refers to traditional Korean music and other related art forms including
                                                songs, dances, and ceremonial movements. The history of music in Korea
                                                should be as long as Korean history itself, but it was only in the early
                                                15th century, during the reign of King Sejong of the Joseon dynasty
                                                (1392–1910), that Korean music became a subject of serious study and was
                                                developed into a system, resulting in the creation of the first mensural
                                                notation system called jeongganbo in Asia. King Sejong’s efforts to
                                                reform the court music led not only to the creation of Korea’s own
                                                notation system but also to the composition of special ritual music
                                                called Jongmyo Jeryeak to be performed during the royal ancestral ritual
                                                (Jongmyo Jerye) in the Jongmyo— inscribed on UNESCO’s Representative
                                                List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2001—and
                                                Yeomillak, or “Joy of the People.” The term gugak was first used by the
                                                Jangagwon, a government agency of late Joseon responsible for music, to
                                                distinguish traditional Korean music from foreign music.</p>
                                            <p class="card-text">Traditional Korean music is typically classified into
                                                several types: the “legitimate music” (called jeongak or jeongga)
                                                enjoyed by the royalty and aristocracy of Joseon; folk music including
                                                pansori, sanjo, and japga; jeongjae (court music and dance) performed
                                                for the King at celebratory state events; music and dance connected with
                                                shamanic and Buddhist traditions such as salpuri, seungmu, and beompae;
                                                and poetic songs beloved of the literati elite such as gagok and sijo.
                                                Of the numerous folk songs, Arirang—inscribed on UNESCO’s Representative

                                                particularly cherished by the common people and there exist many
                                                variations with special lyrics and melodies unique to each region such
                                                as Miryang, Jeongseon, and Jindo.</p>
                                            <p class="card-text">Gugak instruments are similarly diverse. These
                                                traditional musical instruments are generally divided into three
                                                categories: wind instruments such as the piri, daegeum, danso, and
                                                taepyeongso; stringed instruments such as the gayageum, geomungo,
                                                haegeum, ajaeng, and bipa; and percussion instruments such as the buk,
                                                janggu, pyeonjong, pyeongyeong, kkwaenggwari, and jing.</p>

                                                praise from international collectors, is typically divided into three
                                                groups: Cheongja (blue-green celadon), Buncheong (slip-coated
                                                stoneware), and Baekja (white porcelain). Celadon refers to Korean
                                                stoneware, which underwent major development in the hands of Goryeo
                                                potters some 700 to 1,000 years ago. Celadon pottery is marked by an
                                                attractive jade blue surface and the unique Korean inlay technique used
                                                to decorate it. Gangjin of Jeollanam-do and Buan of Jeollabuk-do were
