                                            <h3>A quick look at the Korean education system</h3>
                                            <p>The Korean education system stands out due to the high performance of
                                                its students at the international level according to scores of the
                                                Programme for International Student Assessment of the Organisation
                                                for Economic Co-operation and Development in subjects like reading
                                                and math.

                                                Education is highly valued in the country as a way to obtain a
                                                prestigious place. Thus students are under heavy pressure from
                                                society, teachers and parents, especially when it comes to applying
                                                to enter university.</p>

                                            <p>The Korean education system has served as a model for other countries
                                                such as Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and even those in Latin America
                                                like Mexico, Argentina and Chile. This is because of the nations'
                                                good relations with Korea through academic exchanges conducted by
                                                governments and public and private organizations.
                                                The number of foreign students in Korea rose to 154,000 last year,
                                                according to L. Yoon of Statista, a provider of market and consumer
                                                data, thanks to the nation's higher global image, scholarships for
                                                international students and the popularity of Hallyu. </p>

                                            <p>South Korea is a country where all the world's major religions,
                                                Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Islam, peacefully coexist with
                                                shamanism. According to the 2015 statistics, 44% of South Koreans
                                                identified with a religion.

                                                Among them, Buddhism and Confucianism have been more influential than
                                                any others upon the life of the Korean people, and over half of the
                                                country's listed cultural heritage is related to the two religions.
                                                Since Buddhism arrived in Korea in 372, tens of thousands of temples
                                                have been built across the country.

                                                Adopted as the state ideology of the Joseon dynasty (1392 to 1910),
                                                Confucianism is more of a code of ethical conduct that emphasizes the
                                                importance of loyalty, filial piety, and ancestor worship. Based on the
                                                concepts of Confucianism, the Joseon Dynasty established a code of
                                                conduct to settle the manners and customs of the people's lives. It
                                                stresses the importance of chung, the loyalty of subjects to their king,
                                                hyo, filial, the obedience of children to their parents, and yeol,
                                                duties between the husband and the wife.
                                                Catholicism was introduced to Korea during the late Joseon dynasty
                                                period by diplomats who returned from China and Catholic priests who
                                                were invited by the Korean Christians. The early Roman Catholics in
                                                Korea were subjected to severe persecution, but the religion continued
                                                to spread among the common people across the country. Through the
                                                persecution many Christians were martyred by the rulers at that time,
                                                which led Korea to yield the world's fourth-largest number of Christian
                                                saints.
                                                Protestantism was brought to Korea during the late Joseon dynasty period
                                                and quickly won people's hearts through school education and medical
                                                services. Even today, Protestants in South Korea operate a great number
                                                of educational institutions, middle and high schools, colleges and
                                                universities, and medical centers.</p>

                                                <p>The Korean people learned to use various clothing materials, such as
                                                    sambe (hemp), mosi (ramie), cotton, and silk, to make a range of
                                                    clothing that was not only attractive but also provided them with
                                                    effective protection even during the harshest winters and the
                                                    hottest summers. They made warm winter clothes using the technique
                                                    of wadding soft cotton between two pieces of cloth, silk, or cotton
                                                    fabric, and stitching them in fine lines, and produced cool summer
                                                    clothes with hemp and ramie. Hanbok is the traditional Korean attire
                                                    made with these materials, typically featuring graceful lines and
                                                    forms with a serene aura.

                                                    Korea's traditional clothing, hanbok, has maintained its basic
                                                    traditional features throughout Korea's 5,000-year history while its
                                                    styles and forms have evolved in various ways based on the
                                                    lifestyle, social conditions, and aesthetic taste of the times.

                                                    History reveals that in general, Korean people in the past tended to
                                                    prefer simple, white clothes to fancy ones. That is why they were
                                                    often referred to as “the white-clad people” among their neighbors
                                                    who admired them for being peaceful people. Nonetheless, Korea has
                                                    also had a long tradition of enjoying colorful clothes with complex
                                                    designs depending on the period and the wearer's social status.</p>

                                                <h2>Traditional Food</h2>
                                                <p>Since ancient times, the Korean people have believed that food and
                                                    medicine share the same origin and hence perform the same function,
                                                    following the adage that “food is the best medicine.” They believe
                                                    that health and illness alike come from the food they consume and
                                                    how they eat it, and this idea has played a crucial role in the
                                                    development of traditional Korean medicine whose basic principle is
                                                    that we should use medicine only after food has failed.

                                                    One of the key words to understanding traditional Korean food is
                                                    fermentation, a metabolic process that helps food to “mature” so
                                                    that it can be stored for a longer period. The Korean foods that
                                                    best represent the tradition of fermentation developed in Korea
                                                    include doenjang (soybean paste), ganjang (soy sauce), gochujang
                                                    (chili paste), and jeotgal (fermented fish sauce). The fermentation
                                                    can take anywhere from several months to several years.</p>

                                            <p>Between September 1990 and October 1992, the two Koreas engaged in a
                                                total of eight bilateral meetings, including the first high-level talks
                                                held in Seoul. In December 1991, the two sides signed the Agreement on
                                                Reconciliation, Nonaggression, and Exchanges and Cooperation between the
                                                South and the North (also called the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement). The
                                                agreement focused on mutual respect between the two nations, the
                                                renunciation of armed aggression, exchange and cooperation in many

                                            <p>Korean people have developed unique architectural techniques to build
                                                housing that is properly adapted to the natural environment, providing
                                                dwellers with better protection. One of the distinctive features of the
                                                hanok (traditional Korean house) is an underfloor heating system called
                                                ondol. Ondol, which literally means “warm stones” and was developed
                                                during the prehistoric period, refers to the system of channels running
                                                beneath the stone floor of a room through which heat is delivered from
                                                the fireplace in the kitchen. It is also designed to effectively draw
                                                out the smoke through the under-the-floor passages connected to the
                                                chimney.

                                            <p>Until the mid-20th century, Korea was primarily an agricultural society,
                                                and the seasonal rhythms of daily life were organized by the lunar
                                                calendar. Because farming was hugely important for the subsistence of
                                                the members, such society developed a great variety of semi-religious
                                                events intended to pray for a good harvest and abundant food. Those
                                                events gradually evolved into communal celebrations and festivals.
                                                Korean people celebrate the Lunar New Year's Day (Seol or Seollal), with
                                                a special festival dish called tteokguk or rice cake soup.
