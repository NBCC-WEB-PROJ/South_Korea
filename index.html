                                            <p>The history of the Korean nation began in Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula when people started settling there 700,000 years ago. Representative historic sites associated with the Paleolithic Age, when people made tools of animal horns and chipped stone tools, include the Komun Moru ruins in Sangwon, Pyeongannam-do, the Jeongok-ri Site in Yeoncheon, <span id="collap1" class="collapse"> Gyeonggi-do, the Seokjangri Prehistory Site in Gongju, Chungcheongnam-do, and the Durubong Cave Site in Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk-do. The early inhabitants of the peninsula survived by hunting animals and collecting edible plants in groups.<br>
                                                In Korea, the Neolithic Age began around 8,000 BCE. People started farming, cultivating cereals such as millet, and used polished stone tools. They started settling down permanently in places and formed clan societies. One of the most representative features of the Neolithic Age is comb-patterned pottery, examples of which have been found all across the Korean Peninsula, including in Amsadong, Seoul, in Namgyeong, Pyongyang, and in Suga-ri, Gimhae. The Bronze Age started around the 10th century BCE on the Korean Peninsula and the 15th century BCE in Manchuria. Historic sites associated with the Bronze Age are found in Liaoning and Jilin provinces, China and across the Korean Peninsula. With the development of the Bronze Age culture, a society emerged in which the head of a clan exercised great influence. The strongest clan leaders started merging many clans into one, and these groups very gradually developed into early states.<br>
                                                The tribes that played a central role in the establishment of Gojoseon, which emerged as the first recognizable state of the Korean people, believed in the King of Heaven and worshipped bears, respectively. The two factions jointly upheld Dangun Wanggeom as their chief priest and political leader. Gojoseon fostered an independent culture in Liaoning, China and along the Daedonggang River. By the 3rd century BCE, kings such as King Bu and King Jun had become powerful and bequeathed the throne to their sons. They established a solid system of rule, backed by high-ranking retainers and military officers.<br>
                                                Towards the end of the 3rd century, the Qin dynasty was replaced by the Han dynasty in China, creating a period of social upheaval. Many people moved southward to Gojoseon. Their leader, Wiman, acceded to the throne in 194 BCE and Gojoseon expanded its territory under his rule. By this time, Gojoseon had adopted Iron Age culture, developed agriculture and various handicrafts, and increased its military strength. It tried to monopolize profits, while serving as an intermediate in the trade between the Korean Peninsula and China, taking advantage of its geographical proximity to China. This led to confrontation between Gojoseon and the Han dynasty. Han attacked Gojoseon with a large number of ground and naval forces. Gojoseon defiantly resisted the attack and won a great victory in the early stage of the war, but its capital at Wanggeomseong Fortress fell after a year of war, and Gojoseon collapsed in 108 BCE.</span>

                                            <h5 class="text-center pt-2">Three Kingdoms and Other States</h5>
                                            <p>Towards the end of the Gojoseon Period, tribal states came into being one after another in Manchuria and on the Korean Peninsula. Buyeo was established in the plains along the Songhua River in Manchuria and Jilin. The people of Buyeo grew crops and raised livestock, including horses. They also made furs. By the early 1st century CE, they started <span id="collap2" class="collapse"> calling their main leader the King and actively engaged with other countries, even entering into diplomatic relations with China. By the end of the 3rd century, Buyeo had been incorporated into Goguryeo. The people of Buyeo held an annual festival called Yeonggo in December. During the festival, they held a sacrificial rite for heaven, sang and danced together, and released prisoners.<br>
                                                Buyeo fell apart during the establishment of the regional confederation, but the factions that founded Goguryeo and Baekje took pride in their status as the inheritors of Buyeo. Samguk sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms) states that Gojumong, who founded Goguryeo in 37 BCE, was originally from Buyeo. Goguryeo prospered greatly through victorious wars in areas close to Baekdusan Mountain and along the Amnokgang (Yalu) River. Right after its foundation, Goguryeo conquered a number of small states in the area and moved its capital to Gungnaeseong (Tonggu) near the Amnokgang River. Through many wars, it drove away the factions loyal to the Han dynasty and expanded its territory as far as Liaodong in the west and to the northeast of the Korean Peninsula. It became a powerful state, exerting control over Manchuria and the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.<br>                                                
                                                There were also a number of small states, such as Okjeo and Dongye, in present-day Hamgyeong-do and the northern parts of Gangwon-do along the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. Located in outlying areas, they did not develop very rapidly. Okjeo offered tributes such as salt and fish to Goguryeo. Dongye held a sacrificial rite for heaven called Mucheon in October to build a spirit of collaboration by singing and dancing together. Its specialties included dangung (an archery bow) and gwahama (a horse small enough to pass unhindered beneath fruit trees). These two states were also incorporated into Goguryeo.<br>                                                
                                                The area south of Gojoseon was occupied by a large group of small states including Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan. Mahan was a confederacy of fifty-four small states (composed of 100,000 households in total) located in present-day Gyeonggi-do, Chungcheong-do, and Jeolla-do. Byeonhan was located in presentday Gimhae and Masan while Jinhan located in present-day Daegu and Gyeongju. Each of the latter two was composed of 40,000-50,000 households. The three mini-states were collectively known as Samhan (Three Han States). The people of Samhan held rites of sacrifice for heaven in May and October. On such occasions, they gathered together to enjoy liquor, food, singing and dancing.<br>                                                
                                                Along with the spread of Iron Age culture and the development of farming skills, powerful states such as Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla gradually were established in Manchuria and on the Korean Peninsula.<br>                                                
                                                Goguryeo was the first of the three Kingdoms to firmly establish itself as a sovereign country. It started expanding its territory in the late 1st century and strengthened a king-centered ruling system by the late 2nd century. By the early 4th century, King Micheon of Goguryeo had driven away factions loyal to the Han dynasty from the Korean Peninsula.</span>

                                            <p>With the unification of the three Kingdoms on the Korean Peninsula in 668, Silla enjoyed a marked expansion of both its territory and population. Unified Silla entered a period of dazzling economic development. It mended fences with Tang China. The two countries saw vigorous exchanges between traders, monks, and Confucian scholars. Silla exported <span id="collap3" class="collapse"> gold and silver handiworks and ginseng to Tang and imported books, ceramic ware, satin silk fabric, clothes, and craftwork products. Goods from Central Asia were introduced to Silla, and traders from that region paid visits to Silla via the Silk Road and sea routes.<br>
                                                The major ports of Silla included Ulsan and Danghangseong (present-day Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do), through which numerous goods from Central and Southern Asia were imported. In the early 9th century, General Jang Bo-go of Silla established a forward base in Cheonghaejin (present-day Wando, Jeollanamdo) to deal with the pirate menace and encourage trade with nearby countries including China and Japan.<br>
                                                In the meantime, the survivors of the fallen Kingdom of Goguryeo resisted Tang China's rule. In 698, a group of them led by Dae Jo-yeong, jointly with the Mohe, founded Balhae near present-day Dongmiaoshan in Jilin province, China. The new Kingdom would eventually confront Silla in the south.<br>
                                                Balhae started expanding its territory and regained control over most of the former territory of Goguryeo. During the reign of King Mu, Balhae controlled the northern parts of Manchuria. King Mun reformed the system of governance and moved the capital to Sanggyeong (present-day Ningan-xian, Heilongjiang province) in about 755. The people of Balhae took pride in their Goguryeo inheritance. Letters held in Japan show that the kings of Balhae referred to themselves as the Kings of Goguryeo. Balhae eventually grew so large and strong that the people of Tang China called it Haedong Seongguk (“prosperous country in the east”), but it fell in 926 as a result of an eruption of Baekdusan Mountain and an invasion of the Khitan people.</span>

                                            <h5 class="text-center pt-2">Goryeo Dynasty</h5>
                                            <p>By the late 8th century, Silla had been weakened by an internal struggle for power among the nobility; by the 10th century, leaders of powerful local factions, such as Gyeon Hwon and Gungye, had established their own regimes. In 892, Gyeon Hwon established a Kingdom named Later Baekje, with Wansanju as its capital, and gained control of present-day <span id="collap4" class="collapse"> Jeolla-do and Chungcheong-do.<br>
                                                In 901, Gungye, a member of the Silla royal family, founded Later Goguryeo in Songak (present-day Gaeseong), exerting control over present-day Gangwon-do and Gyeonggi-do. He expanded the territory, reformed the ruling system, and relocated the capital to Cheorwon. He also changed the name of the country to Taebong.<br>                                                
                                                Gungye lost the support of his people while exerting control over local leaders and strengthening his claim to the throne. In 918, he was driven away by Wang Geon, a local leader from Songak. Wang Geon changed the name of the country to Goryeo, announced that the country would inherit Goguryeo, and moved the capital to Songak. Goryeo remained hostile to Later Baekje while actively promoting a policy of engaging Silla. In 935, Unified Silla was peacefully incorporated into Goryeo. Following a power struggle among leaders in Later Baekje, Gyeon Hwon surrendered to Wang Geon. In 936, Later Baekje fell to Goryeo. Thus, Wang Geon unified the Later Three Kingdoms on the Korean Peninsula.<br>                                                
                                                Goryeo adopted Confucianism as its political ideology and established an effective education system by founding the Gukjagam (a national higher education institution) and numerous hyanggyo (local private schools). Buddhism also exerted considerable influence over Goryeo society in general. The Kingdom adopted a more tolerant approach towards the acceptance of other religions, as indicated by the rites called Yeondeunghoe (Lotus Lantern Festival) and Palgwanhoe (Festival of the Eight Vows), in which prayers were offered for blessing, based on a syncretic mix of folk religions and Buddhism.<br>                                                
                                                Goryeo engaged in brisk trade with many countries, including the Song dynasty. Many traders from Song, Central Asia, Arabia, Southeast Asia and Japan travelled to Byeongnando, a gateway to the capital, Gaeseong. Traders from Song sold satin, silk and medicinal herbs, while traders from Goryeo sold hemp cloth and ginseng. Gems such as ivory, crystal, amber were imported from Arabia. Finally, the name Korea originated from Goryeo during this period.</span>

                                            <p>Towards the end of the 14th century, Goryeo found itself in a difficult situation due to internal and external problems, including a struggle for power among the nobility and incursions by red-turbaned bandits and Wako pirates. At that time, General Yi Seong-gye had become popular among the people for his role in driving away foreign invaders. <span id="collap5" class="collapse"> He overthrew the Goryeo dynasty and founded a new dynasty, Joseon. As the first King Taejo of Joseon, he chose Hanyang (present day Seoul) – judged to be a propitious spot according to the principles of feng shui – as the capital of the new dynasty. He also ordered the construction of Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Jongmyo shrine, as well as roads and markets. The new capital, located in the center of the Korean Peninsula, was easily accessible via the Hangang River, which flowed directly through its heart.<br>
                                                King Taejong, the third king and son of the founder of the dynasty, made a significant contribution to stabilizing the centralized system of governance. He adopted a system under the law of hopae (identification tags) to figure out the population, and launched the major executive bodies called the Six Ministries of Joseon: Personnel (Ijo), Taxation (Hojo), Rites (Yejo), Military Affairs (Byeongjo), Punishments (Hyeongjo), and Public Works (Gongjo), all of which had to report directly to their king. King Sejong, the fourth king and a son of King Taejong, ushered in an era of great political, social, and cultural prosperity. Scholars at the Jiphyeonjeon (Hall of Worthies) developed strong and effective policies. During the reigns of Sejo, Yejong, and Seongjong, the Gyeongguk daejeon (National Code) was drawn up with the aim of establishing a long-lasting ruling system.</span>

                                            <p>With the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, capitalism developed in Europe and large businesses came into being. European countries expanded their colonies in Asia and Africa. By the mid-19th century, the western powers had forced the Qing dynasty of China and Japan to open their doors and then asked the same of Joseon, but <span id="collap6" class="collapse"> Joseon duly rejected such requests. Joseon did not yield to pressure applied in the form of naval attacks in 1866 (by the French) and 1871 (by the Americans).<br>
                                                In the ensuing period, the pressure did not stop. In 1875, Japan dispatched the battleship Unyo Maru to attack Ganghwado and Yeongjongdo Islands, demanding that Joseon open its doors to foreign trade missions. Ultimately, Joseon was forced to sign the highly unequal, one-sided Korean-Japanese Treaty, or Ganghwa Treaty (1876) with Japan in 1876 under military threat.<br>                                                
                                                Subsequently, imperialist powers, including Japan, vied with each other to pillage Joseon’s resources. In 1897, Joseon changed its name to the Korean Empire (Daehan Jeguk) and pushed ahead with reforms and an open-door policy, but it was too late. Japan soon won major victories in its wars against the Qing dynasty and Russia, emerged as a strong power in Northeast Asia, and took steps to annex Joseon. Many Korean patriots, including Ahn Jung-geun, resisted such a plan, but to no avail. In August 1910, the Korean Empire was formally annexed by the Empire of Japan.</span>

                                            <p>During the colonial period, the Japanese pillaged Joseon's resources, banned the use of the Korean language-even going so far in 1939 as to require Koreans to change their personal names to Japanese style surnames and given names under the Name Order, and conscripted Koreans into their work force or as uniformed soldiers in the Pacific War. <span id="collap7" class="collapse"> Koreans engaged in persistent struggles to regain their independence. They organized numerous clandestine organizations to fight the Japanese within the country such as Joseon National Sovereignty Restoration Group and The Korea Liberation Corps. They also established forward bases for the independence movement in China, Russia, and the United States and led unprecedentedly peaceful demonstrations. In March 1919, Korean leaders announced the Declaration of Independence. Students and ordinary people staged street demonstrations across the country shouting their motto, “Long Live Korean Independence!” The movement spread to the Koreans resisting in Manchuria, the Maritime Provinces of Siberia, the United States, Europe, and even to Japan. Following the March 1st Movement, organizations representing Koreans were established in Seoul, the Maritime Province of Siberia, and Shanghai. Of these, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, which was established in Shanghai, China, is the country’s first democratic republican government; it was equipped with a modern Constitution and a political system that separated the three basic branches (executive, legislature and judicial) of government.<br>
                                                Koreans also carried out armed struggles against the Japanese. In the 1920s, more than 30 Korean independence army units engaged in resistance activities in Manchuria and the Maritime Provinces of Siberia. For example, in June 1920, the Battle of Fengwudong was a battle that occurred in Fengwutung, Jilin province, China between Japanese forces and Korean independence militias led by Hong Beom-do to a big victory. Another is the Battle of Qingshanli, which was fought over six days in October 1920 between the Imperial Japanese Army and the Northern Military Administration Office Army led by Kim Jwa-jin along with other Korean armed groups. They won a great victory against Japanese troops in Helongxian, Manchuria.<br>
                                                In 1940, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (PGK) organized the Korean Liberation Army in Chungqing, integrating many scattered volunteer independence armies and militias in Manchuria. The PGK declared war against Japan and dispatched troops to the front lines in India and Myanmar to fight on the side of the Allied Forces. Some young Koreans received special training from a special military unit of the United States to better equip themselves to attack Japanese forces in Korea. On August 15, 1945, Koreans finally received what they had looked forward to for so long: the country's liberation as a result of Japan's surrender in the Pacific War. U.S. and Soviet troops were deployed to the south and north of the 38th parallel, respectively to disarm Japanese troops remaining on the Korean Peninsula.</span>

                                            <p>On May 10, 1948, the first general election was held in a democratic manner in South Korea under the UN’s supervision to elect the 198 members of the National Assembly. In July of the same year, the Constitution was enacted and Rhee Syngman and Yi Si-yeong, two independence fighters deeply respected by Koreans, were elected as the country's <span id="collap8" class="collapse"> first President and Vice President, respectively. On August 15, 1948, the Republic of Korea (ROK) was formally established as a liberal democracy, which inherited the legitimacy of the PGK. The UN recognized the government of the ROK as the only legitimate government on the Korean Peninsula.<br>
                                                However, to the north of the 38th parallel, a general election under UN supervision could not be carried out due to the Soviet Union’s opposition. On September 9, 1948, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) was proclaimed as a communist country, and Kim Il-sung, who had served as an officer of the Soviet Russian Army, was sworn in as the President. Amid the confrontation between a free democracy in the south and a communist dictatorship in the north, the ROK government led by President Rhee Syngman was burdened with many issues such as establishing domestic order, eliminating vestiges of Japanese imperialism, and overcoming ideological confrontations between the left and the right.<br>                                                
                                                On June 25, 1950, North Korean troops armed with Soviet-made tanks and fighters invaded the South, thus triggering an all-out war. The UN Security Council unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion and published a resolution recommending that its member states provide military assistance to South Korea. When the tide of the war turned against the North with the intervention of the UN Forces, the Chinese Red Army intervened in the war on the North’s side. The two sides engaged in fierce battles until, on July 27, 1953, the two sides finally signed the armistice agreement. President Rhee Syngman did not sign the agreement, calling strongly for the prolongation of the war with the goal of unifying the entire country in the South's favor.</span>

Winters can be extremely cold with the minimum temperature dropping below -20 °C in the inland region of the country: in Seoul, the average January temperature range is -7 to 1 °C, and the average August temperature range is 22 to 30 °C. Winter temperatures are higher along the southern coast and considerably lower in the mountainous interior. Summer can be uncomfortably hot and humid, with temperatures exceeding 30 °C in most parts of the country. South Korea has four distinct seasons; spring, summer, autumn and winter. Spring usually lasts from late March to early May, summer from mid-May to early September, autumn from mid-September to early November, and winter from mid-November to mid-March.<br>
                                        Rainfall is concentrated in the summer months of June through September. The southern coast is subject to late summer typhoons that bring strong winds, heavy rains and sometimes floods. The average annual precipitation varies from 1,370 millimeters in Seoul to 1,470 millimeters in Busan.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">In South Korea, there are five national holidays designated by
                                        the government. First, March 1st Movement Day commemorates the Korean
                                        independence movement, which was held by the public on March 1, 1919 to show
                                        resistence against the Japanese occupation of Korea. Second, Constitution Day or
                                        Jeheonjeol is observed on July 17th, the day that the South Korean constitution
                                        was proclaimed in 1948. Third, National Liberation Day (Gwangbokjeol, August
                                        15), celebrated annually on August 15th, is to commemorate Victory over Japan
                                        Day at the end of World War II. Fourth, National Foundation Day (Gaecheonjeol),
                                        celebrated annually on October 3rd, is to mark the foundation of Gojoseon, the
                                        first state of the Korean nation, on the 3rd day of the 10th lunar month, 2333
                                        BCE. Fifth and last, Hangeul Proclamation Day (Hangeul Day), celebrated annually
                                        on October 9th, is to commemorate the invention and proclamation of the Korean
                                        writing system.</p>
                                    <h5>Public Holidays</h5>

                                        South Korea include New Year’s Day, Seollal (or Lunar New Year’s Day, celebrated
                                        for 3 days), Chuseok (Mid-autumn Festival on the 15th day of the 8th lunar

                                        lunar month), Children’s Day (May 5), Memorial Day (June 6), and Christmas Day.
                                        There are 15 public holidays in total on which businesses are closed by law and
                                        employees have a day off, from which Constitution Day is excluded.</p>

                                                Korean food
                                                is fermentation, a metabolic process that helps food to “mature” so that
                                                it can
                                                be stored for a longer period. The Korean foods that best represent the
                                                tradition of fermentation developed in Korea include doenjang (soybean

                                                ganjang (soy sauce), gochujang (chili paste), and jeotgal (fermented

                                                in Korea are doenjang and ganjang. To make them, it is necessary to soak
                                                soybeans in water and boil them until fully cooked. Then, they must be
                                                pounded
                                                and formed into brick-shaped lumps, and left to dry and ferment. Then,
                                                they are
                                                placed in salted water in a large pot along with dried red chili and
                                                heated
                                                charcoal, which help remove impurities and odors during the fermentation
                                                process. The beans thus prepared are then left for about two to three
                                                months
                                                until they become fully fermented. This product should then be divided
                                                into two,
                                                solids and liquid, of which the former needs to be brewed for over five
                                                more
                                                months and the latter for over three months to develop a full flavor and
                                                taste.
                                                Just like wine, soy sauce tends to have a richer flavor and taste when
                                                brewed
                                                for a longer period..</p>

                                                refers to traditional Korean music and other related art forms including
                                                songs, dances, and ceremonial movements. The history of music in Korea
                                                should be as long as Korean history itself, but it was only in the early
                                                15th century, during the reign of King Sejong of the Joseon dynasty
                                                (1392–1910), that Korean music became a subject of serious study and was
                                                developed into a system, resulting in the creation of the first mensural
                                                notation system called jeongganbo in Asia. King Sejong’s efforts to
                                                reform the court music led not only to the creation of Korea’s own
                                                notation system but also to the composition of special ritual music
                                                called Jongmyo Jeryeak to be performed during the royal ancestral ritual

                                                Yeomillak, or “Joy of the People.” The term gugak was first used by the
                                                Jangagwon, a government agency of late Joseon responsible for music, to

                                                several types: the “legitimate music” (called jeongak or jeongga)
                                                enjoyed by the royalty and aristocracy of Joseon; folk music including
                                                pansori, sanjo, and japga; jeongjae (court music and dance) performed
                                                for the King at celebratory state events; music and dance connected with
                                                shamanic and Buddhist traditions such as salpuri, seungmu, and beompae;
                                                and poetic songs beloved of the literati elite such as gagok and sijo.

                                        exchange rate is 1107.12 – approximately 1100 KRW = 1 USD. Although high, the
