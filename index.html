                                            <p>The history of the Korean nation began in Manchuria and the Korean
                                                Peninsula when people started settling there 700,000 years ago.
                                                Representative historic sites associated with the Paleolithic Age, when
                                                people made tools of animal horns and chipped stone tools, include the
                                                Komun Moru ruins in Sangwon, Pyeongannam-do, the Jeongok-ri Site in
                                                Yeoncheon, <span id="collap1" class="collapse"> Gyeonggi-do, the
                                                    Seokjangri Prehistory Site in Gongju, Chungcheongnam-do, and the
                                                    Durubong Cave Site in Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk-do. The early
                                                    inhabitants of the peninsula survived by hunting animals and
                                                    collecting edible plants in groups.<br>
                                                    In Korea, the Neolithic Age began around 8,000 BCE. People started
                                                    farming, cultivating cereals such as millet, and used polished stone
                                                    tools. They started settling down permanently in places and formed
                                                    clan societies. One of the most representative features of the
                                                    Neolithic Age is comb-patterned pottery, examples of which have been
                                                    found all across the Korean Peninsula, including in Amsadong, Seoul,
                                                    in Namgyeong, Pyongyang, and in Suga-ri, Gimhae. The Bronze Age
                                                    started around the 10th century BCE on the Korean Peninsula and the
                                                    15th century BCE in Manchuria. Historic sites associated with the
                                                    Bronze Age are found in Liaoning and Jilin provinces, China and
                                                    across the Korean Peninsula. With the development of the Bronze Age
                                                    culture, a society emerged in which the head of a clan exercised
                                                    great influence. The strongest clan leaders started merging many
                                                    clans into one, and these groups very gradually developed into early
                                                    states.<br>
                                                    The tribes that played a central role in the establishment of
                                                    Gojoseon, which emerged as the first recognizable state of the
                                                    Korean people, believed in the King of Heaven and worshipped bears,
                                                    respectively. The two factions jointly upheld Dangun Wanggeom as
                                                    their chief priest and political leader. Gojoseon fostered an
                                                    independent culture in Liaoning, China and along the Daedonggang
                                                    River. By the 3rd century BCE, kings such as King Bu and King Jun
                                                    had become powerful and bequeathed the throne to their sons. They
                                                    established a solid system of rule, backed by high-ranking retainers
                                                    and military officers.<br>
                                                    Towards the end of the 3rd century, the Qin dynasty was replaced by
                                                    the Han dynasty in China, creating a period of social upheaval. Many
                                                    people moved southward to Gojoseon. Their leader, Wiman, acceded to
                                                    the throne in 194 BCE and Gojoseon expanded its territory under his
                                                    rule. By this time, Gojoseon had adopted Iron Age culture, developed
                                                    agriculture and various handicrafts, and increased its military
                                                    strength. It tried to monopolize profits, while serving as an
                                                    intermediate in the trade between the Korean Peninsula and China,
                                                    taking advantage of its geographical proximity to China. This led to
                                                    confrontation between Gojoseon and the Han dynasty. Han attacked
                                                    Gojoseon with a large number of ground and naval forces. Gojoseon
                                                    defiantly resisted the attack and won a great victory in the early
                                                    stage of the war, but its capital at Wanggeomseong Fortress fell
                                                    after a year of war, and Gojoseon collapsed in 108 BCE.</span>

                                            <p>Towards the end of the Gojoseon Period, tribal states came into being one
                                                after another in Manchuria and on the Korean Peninsula. Buyeo was
                                                established in the plains along the Songhua River in Manchuria and
                                                Jilin. The people of Buyeo grew crops and raised livestock, including
                                                horses. They also made furs. By the early 1st century CE, they started
                                                <span id="collap2" class="collapse"> calling their main leader the King
                                                    and actively engaged with other countries, even entering into
                                                    diplomatic relations with China. By the end of the 3rd century,
                                                    Buyeo had been incorporated into Goguryeo. The people of Buyeo held
                                                    an annual festival called Yeonggo in December. During the festival,
                                                    they held a sacrificial rite for heaven, sang and danced together,
                                                    and released prisoners.<br>
                                                    Buyeo fell apart during the establishment of the regional
                                                    confederation, but the factions that founded Goguryeo and Baekje
                                                    took pride in their status as the inheritors of Buyeo. Samguk sagi
                                                    (History of the Three Kingdoms) states that Gojumong, who founded
                                                    Goguryeo in 37 BCE, was originally from Buyeo. Goguryeo prospered
                                                    greatly through victorious wars in areas close to Baekdusan Mountain
                                                    and along the Amnokgang (Yalu) River. Right after its foundation,
                                                    Goguryeo conquered a number of small states in the area and moved
                                                    its capital to Gungnaeseong (Tonggu) near the Amnokgang River.
                                                    Through many wars, it drove away the factions loyal to the Han
                                                    dynasty and expanded its territory as far as Liaodong in the west
                                                    and to the northeast of the Korean Peninsula. It became a powerful
                                                    state, exerting control over Manchuria and the northern part of the
                                                    Korean Peninsula.<br>
                                                    There were also a number of small states, such as Okjeo and Dongye,
                                                    in present-day Hamgyeong-do and the northern parts of Gangwon-do
                                                    along the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. Located in outlying
                                                    areas, they did not develop very rapidly. Okjeo offered tributes
                                                    such as salt and fish to Goguryeo. Dongye held a sacrificial rite
                                                    for heaven called Mucheon in October to build a spirit of
                                                    collaboration by singing and dancing together. Its specialties
                                                    included dangung (an archery bow) and gwahama (a horse small enough
                                                    to pass unhindered beneath fruit trees). These two states were also
                                                    incorporated into Goguryeo.<br>
                                                    The area south of Gojoseon was occupied by a large group of small
                                                    states including Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan. Mahan was a
                                                    confederacy of fifty-four small states (composed of 100,000
                                                    households in total) located in present-day Gyeonggi-do,
                                                    Chungcheong-do, and Jeolla-do. Byeonhan was located in presentday
                                                    Gimhae and Masan while Jinhan located in present-day Daegu and
                                                    Gyeongju. Each of the latter two was composed of 40,000-50,000
                                                    households. The three mini-states were collectively known as Samhan
                                                    (Three Han States). The people of Samhan held rites of sacrifice for
                                                    heaven in May and October. On such occasions, they gathered together
                                                    to enjoy liquor, food, singing and dancing.<br>
                                                    Along with the spread of Iron Age culture and the development of
                                                    farming skills, powerful states such as Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla
                                                    gradually were established in Manchuria and on the Korean
                                                    Peninsula.<br>
                                                    Goguryeo was the first of the three Kingdoms to firmly establish
                                                    itself as a sovereign country. It started expanding its territory in
                                                    the late 1st century and strengthened a king-centered ruling system
                                                    by the late 2nd century. By the early 4th century, King Micheon of
                                                    Goguryeo had driven away factions loyal to the Han dynasty from the
                                                    Korean Peninsula.</span>

                                            <p>With the unification of the three Kingdoms on the Korean Peninsula in
                                                668, Silla enjoyed a marked expansion of both its territory and
                                                population. Unified Silla entered a period of dazzling economic
                                                development. It mended fences with Tang China. The two countries saw
                                                vigorous exchanges between traders, monks, and Confucian scholars. Silla
                                                exported <span id="collap3" class="collapse"> gold and silver handiworks

                                                    fabric, clothes, and craftwork products. Goods from Central Asia
                                                    were introduced to Silla, and traders from that region paid visits
                                                    to Silla via the Silk Road and sea routes.<br>
                                                    The major ports of Silla included Ulsan and Danghangseong
                                                    (present-day Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do), through which numerous goods
                                                    from Central and Southern Asia were imported. In the early 9th
                                                    century, General Jang Bo-go of Silla established a forward base in
                                                    Cheonghaejin (present-day Wando, Jeollanamdo) to deal with the
                                                    pirate menace and encourage trade with nearby countries including
                                                    China and Japan.<br>
                                                    In the meantime, the survivors of the fallen Kingdom of Goguryeo
                                                    resisted Tang China's rule. In 698, a group of them led by Dae
                                                    Jo-yeong, jointly with the Mohe, founded Balhae near present-day
                                                    Dongmiaoshan in Jilin province, China. The new Kingdom would
                                                    eventually confront Silla in the south.<br>
                                                    Balhae started expanding its territory and regained control over
                                                    most of the former territory of Goguryeo. During the reign of King
                                                    Mu, Balhae controlled the northern parts of Manchuria. King Mun
                                                    reformed the system of governance and moved the capital to
                                                    Sanggyeong (present-day Ningan-xian, Heilongjiang province) in about
                                                    755. The people of Balhae took pride in their Goguryeo inheritance.
                                                    Letters held in Japan show that the kings of Balhae referred to

                                            <p>By the late 8th century, Silla had been weakened by an internal struggle
                                                for power among the nobility; by the 10th century, leaders of powerful
                                                local factions, such as Gyeon Hwon and Gungye, had established their own
                                                regimes. In 892, Gyeon Hwon established a Kingdom named Later Baekje,
                                                with Wansanju as its capital, and gained control of present-day <span

                                                    In 901, Gungye, a member of the Silla royal family, founded Later
                                                    Goguryeo in Songak (present-day Gaeseong), exerting control over
                                                    present-day Gangwon-do and Gyeonggi-do. He expanded the territory,
                                                    reformed the ruling system, and relocated the capital to Cheorwon.
                                                    He also changed the name of the country to Taebong.<br>
                                                    Gungye lost the support of his people while exerting control over
                                                    local leaders and strengthening his claim to the throne. In 918, he
                                                    was driven away by Wang Geon, a local leader from Songak. Wang Geon
                                                    changed the name of the country to Goryeo, announced that the
                                                    country would inherit Goguryeo, and moved the capital to Songak.
                                                    Goryeo remained hostile to Later Baekje while actively promoting a
                                                    policy of engaging Silla. In 935, Unified Silla was peacefully
                                                    incorporated into Goryeo. Following a power struggle among leaders
                                                    in Later Baekje, Gyeon Hwon surrendered to Wang Geon. In 936, Later
                                                    Baekje fell to Goryeo. Thus, Wang Geon unified the Later Three
                                                    Kingdoms on the Korean Peninsula.<br>
                                                    Goryeo adopted Confucianism as its political ideology and
                                                    established an effective education system by founding the Gukjagam
                                                    (a national higher education institution) and numerous hyanggyo
                                                    (local private schools). Buddhism also exerted considerable
                                                    influence over Goryeo society in general. The Kingdom adopted a more
                                                    tolerant approach towards the acceptance of other religions, as
                                                    indicated by the rites called Yeondeunghoe (Lotus Lantern Festival)
                                                    and Palgwanhoe (Festival of the Eight Vows), in which prayers were
                                                    offered for blessing, based on a syncretic mix of folk religions and
                                                    Buddhism.<br>
                                                    Goryeo engaged in brisk trade with many countries, including the
                                                    Song dynasty. Many traders from Song, Central Asia, Arabia,
                                                    Southeast Asia and Japan travelled to Byeongnando, a gateway to the
                                                    capital, Gaeseong. Traders from Song sold satin, silk and medicinal
                                                    herbs, while traders from Goryeo sold hemp cloth and ginseng. Gems
                                                    such as ivory, crystal, amber were imported from Arabia. Finally,
                                                    the name Korea originated from Goryeo during this period.</span>

                                                for power among the nobility and incursions by red-turbaned bandits and
                                                Wako pirates. At that time, General Yi Seong-gye had become popular
                                                among the people for his role in driving away foreign invaders. <span

                                                    founded a new dynasty, Joseon. As the first King Taejo of Joseon, he
                                                    chose Hanyang (present day Seoul) – judged to be a propitious spot

                                                capitalism developed in Europe and large businesses came into being.
                                                European countries expanded their colonies in Asia and Africa. By the

                                                    with Japan in 1876 under military threat.<br>
                                                    Subsequently, imperialist powers, including Japan, vied with each
                                                    other to pillage Joseon's resources. In 1897, Joseon changed its
                                                    name to the Korean Empire (Daehan Jeguk) and pushed ahead with
                                                    reforms and an open-door policy, but it was too late. Japan soon won
                                                    major victories in its wars against the Qing dynasty and Russia,
                                                    emerged as a strong power in Northeast Asia, and took steps to annex
                                                    Joseon. Many Korean patriots, including Ahn Jung-geun, resisted such
                                                    a plan, but to no avail. In August 1910, the Korean Empire was
                                                    formally annexed by the Empire of Japan.</span>

                                                    Liberation Corps. They also established forward bases for the

                                                    led unprecedentedly peaceful demonstrations. In March 1919, Korean
                                                    leaders announced the Declaration of Independence. Students and
                                                    ordinary people staged street demonstrations across the country
                                                    shouting their motto, “Long Live Korean Independence!” The movement
                                                    spread to the Koreans resisting in Manchuria, the Maritime Provinces

                                                    first democratic republican government; it was equipped with a
                                                    modern Constitution and a political system that separated the three

                                                    Koreans also carried out armed struggles against the Japanese. In
                                                    the 1920s, more than 30 Korean independence army units engaged in
                                                    resistance activities in Manchuria and the Maritime Provinces of
                                                    Siberia. For example, in June 1920, the Battle of Fengwudong was a
                                                    battle that occurred in Fengwutung, Jilin province, China between
                                                    Japanese forces and Korean independence militias led by Hong Beom-do
                                                    to a big victory. Another is the Battle of Qingshanli, which was
                                                    fought over six days in October 1920 between the Imperial Japanese
                                                    Army and the Northern Military Administration Office Army led by Kim
                                                    Jwa-jin along with other Korean armed groups. They won a great
                                                    victory against Japanese troops in Helongxian, Manchuria.<br>
                                                    In 1940, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (PGK)
                                                    organized the Korean Liberation Army in Chungqing, integrating many
                                                    scattered volunteer independence armies and militias in Manchuria.
                                                    The PGK declared war against Japan and dispatched troops to the
                                                    front lines in India and Myanmar to fight on the side of the Allied
                                                    Forces. Some young Koreans received special training from a special
                                                    military unit of the United States to better equip themselves to
                                                    attack Japanese forces in Korea. On August 15, 1945, Koreans finally
                                                    received what they had looked forward to for so long: the country's

                                                    and Soviet troops were deployed to the south and north of the 38th
                                                    parallel, respectively to disarm Japanese troops remaining on the

                                                members of the National Assembly. In July of the same year, the

                                                    (ROK) was formally established as a liberal democracy, which
                                                    inherited the legitimacy of the PGK. The UN recognized the

                                                    However, to the north of the 38th parallel, a general election under
                                                    UN supervision could not be carried out due to the Soviet Union's
                                                    opposition. On September 9, 1948, the Democratic People's Republic
                                                    of Korea (DPRK) was proclaimed as a communist country, and Kim

                                                    was sworn in as the President. Amid the confrontation between a free
                                                    democracy in the south and a communist dictatorship in the north,
                                                    the ROK government led by President Rhee Syngman was burdened with
                                                    many issues such as establishing domestic order, eliminating
                                                    vestiges of Japanese imperialism, and overcoming ideological
                                                    confrontations between the left and the right.<br>
                                                    On June 25, 1950, North Korean troops armed with Soviet-made tanks
                                                    and fighters invaded the South, thus triggering an all-out war. The
                                                    UN Security Council unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion
                                                    and published a resolution recommending that its member states
                                                    provide military assistance to South Korea. When the tide of the war
                                                    turned against the North with the intervention of the UN Forces, the
                                                    Chinese Red Army intervened in the war on the North's side. The two

                                                    sides finally signed the armistice agreement. President Rhee Syngman
                                                    did not sign the agreement, calling strongly for the prolongation of

                                            <p>The Korean education system stands out due to the high performance of
                                                its students at the international level according to scores of the
                                                Programme for International Student Assessment of the Organisation
                                                for Economic Co-operation and Development in subjects like reading
                                                and math.

                                                Education is highly valued in the country as a way to obtain a
                                                prestigious place. Thus students are under heavy pressure from
                                                society, teachers and parents, especially when it comes to applying
                                                to enter university.</p>

                                                such as Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and even those in Latin America
                                                like Mexico, Argentina and Chile. This is because of the nations'
                                                good relations with Korea through academic exchanges conducted by
                                                governments and public and private organizations.
                                                The number of foreign students in Korea rose to 154,000 last year,
                                                according to L. Yoon of Statista, a provider of market and consumer
                                                data, thanks to the nation's higher global image, scholarships for
                                                international students and the popularity of Hallyu. </p>

                                            <p>South Korea is a country where all the world's major religions,
                                                Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Islam, peacefully coexist with
                                                shamanism. According to the 2015 statistics, 44% of South Koreans
                                                identified with a religion.

                                                Among them, Buddhism and Confucianism have been more influential than
                                                any others upon the life of the Korean people, and over half of the
                                                country's listed cultural heritage is related to the two religions.
                                                Since Buddhism arrived in Korea in 372, tens of thousands of temples
                                                have been built across the country.

                                                Adopted as the state ideology of the Joseon dynasty (1392 to 1910),
                                                Confucianism is more of a code of ethical conduct that emphasizes the
                                                importance of loyalty, filial piety, and ancestor worship. Based on the
                                                concepts of Confucianism, the Joseon Dynasty established a code of
                                                conduct to settle the manners and customs of the people's lives. It
                                                stresses the importance of chung, the loyalty of subjects to their king,
                                                hyo, filial, the obedience of children to their parents, and yeol,
                                                duties between the husband and the wife.
                                                Catholicism was introduced to Korea during the late Joseon dynasty
                                                period by diplomats who returned from China and Catholic priests who
                                                were invited by the Korean Christians. The early Roman Catholics in
                                                Korea were subjected to severe persecution, but the religion continued
                                                to spread among the common people across the country. Through the
                                                persecution many Christians were martyred by the rulers at that time,
                                                which led Korea to yield the world's fourth-largest number of Christian
                                                saints.
                                                Protestantism was brought to Korea during the late Joseon dynasty period
                                                and quickly won people's hearts through school education and medical
                                                services. Even today, Protestants in South Korea operate a great number
                                                of educational institutions, middle and high schools, colleges and
                                                universities, and medical centers.</p>

                                                <h2>Clothing and Fashion</h2>
                                                <p>The Korean people learned to use various clothing materials, such as
                                                    sambe (hemp), mosi (ramie), cotton, and silk, to make a range of
                                                    clothing that was not only attractive but also provided them with
                                                    effective protection even during the harshest winters and the
                                                    hottest summers. They made warm winter clothes using the technique
                                                    of wadding soft cotton between two pieces of cloth, silk, or cotton
                                                    fabric, and stitching them in fine lines, and produced cool summer
                                                    clothes with hemp and ramie. Hanbok is the traditional Korean attire
                                                    made with these materials, typically featuring graceful lines and
                                                    forms with a serene aura.

                                                    Korea's traditional clothing, hanbok, has maintained its basic
                                                    traditional features throughout Korea's 5,000-year history while its
                                                    styles and forms have evolved in various ways based on the
                                                    lifestyle, social conditions, and aesthetic taste of the times.

                                                    History reveals that in general, Korean people in the past tended to
                                                    prefer simple, white clothes to fancy ones. That is why they were
                                                    often referred to as “the white-clad people” among their neighbors
                                                    who admired them for being peaceful people. Nonetheless, Korea has
                                                    also had a long tradition of enjoying colorful clothes with complex
                                                    designs depending on the period and the wearer's social status.</p>

                                                <h2>Traditional Food</h2>
                                                <p>Since ancient times, the Korean people have believed that food and
                                                    medicine share the same origin and hence perform the same function,
                                                    following the adage that “food is the best medicine.” They believe
                                                    that health and illness alike come from the food they consume and
                                                    how they eat it, and this idea has played a crucial role in the
                                                    development of traditional Korean medicine whose basic principle is
                                                    that we should use medicine only after food has failed.

                                                    One of the key words to understanding traditional Korean food is
                                                    fermentation, a metabolic process that helps food to “mature” so
                                                    that it can be stored for a longer period. The Korean foods that
                                                    best represent the tradition of fermentation developed in Korea
                                                    include doenjang (soybean paste), ganjang (soy sauce), gochujang
                                                    (chili paste), and jeotgal (fermented fish sauce). The fermentation
                                                    can take anywhere from several months to several years.</p>

                                                held in Seoul. In December 1991, the two sides signed the Agreement on

                                            <p>Korean people have developed unique architectural techniques to build
                                                housing that is properly adapted to the natural environment, providing
                                                dwellers with better protection. One of the distinctive features of the
                                                hanok (traditional Korean house) is an underfloor heating system called
                                                ondol. Ondol, which literally means “warm stones” and was developed
                                                during the prehistoric period, refers to the system of channels running
                                                beneath the stone floor of a room through which heat is delivered from
                                                the fireplace in the kitchen. It is also designed to effectively draw

                                            <h2>Inter-Korean Exchanges and Cooperation</h2>
                                            <p>Until the mid-20th century, Korea was primarily an agricultural society,
                                                and the seasonal rhythms of daily life were organized by the lunar
                                                calendar. Because farming was hugely important for the subsistence of
                                                the members, such society developed a great variety of semi-religious
                                                events intended to pray for a good harvest and abundant food. Those
                                                events gradually evolved into communal celebrations and festivals.
                                                Korean people celebrate the Lunar New Year's Day (Seol or Seollal), with
                                                a special festival dish called tteokguk or rice cake soup.
